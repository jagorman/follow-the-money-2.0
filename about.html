<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>This project is a work of love. 4 students in the KU Data Analytics Boot Camp began a project attempting to create a voter tool that would quickly, interactively, and efefctively assist Voters in knowing who the top donors were to their Federal Elected Officals. The first attempt was a "dumpster fire." They decided to repeat this process with an added feature (the predictor) and an extra team memember. It is their sincere hope that voters in Missouri and Kansas will find this to be a helpful and educational tool.</p>
