                <p> 4 students in the KU Data Analytics Boot Camp got a fantastic idea- what if they created a voter
                    tool that would quickly, interactively, and effectively assist Voters in knowing who the top donors
                    were to their Federal Elected Officals? In May of 2021 they began a project attempting to do just
                    that. </p>
                <p>The first attempt was a dumpster-fire</p>
                <p> <a class="navbar-brand" href="https://github.com/jagorman/Follow-the-Money">
                        <img src="assets/dumpsterfire.jpg" alt="" width="80" height="80">
                    </a></p>
                <p>After discussing the wins and losses of the last attempt, they decided to try again, adding a new
                    team member, a new endgame, a predictor feature, and a better plan.</p>

                <p>It is their sincere hope that voters in Missouri and Kansas will find this to be a helpful and
                    educational
                    tool.
                </p>
                <p>This project is a work of love.</p>
